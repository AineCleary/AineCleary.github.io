        <h3>Early Life</h3>
		<p>I was born in the year <strong>1998</strong>. When 
		it was time for me to go to primary school
		I went to the <em>Gael Scoil</em> in Newbrigde. Once 
		I finished primary I went <em>Gael-Choláiste Chill 
		Dara</em> for secondary school. I finished school
		in 2017 after I finished my leaving cert.
		I had quite a few pets growing up, though 
		they were mostly cats. I participated in 
		multiple extra cericular activities like
		horse riding, irish dancing and even Taekwondo.</p>
		
		<h3>Now</h3>
		<p>At the moment I'm currently attending <strong>IT 
		Carlow</strong> in the Games Development course.
		Things are going pretty well. </p>
